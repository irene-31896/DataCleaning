# Data Cleaning with Python

## Applying Python
I've learned Python years ago through "Automate the Boring Stuff". I remembered I had so much fun completing the challenges but a year of not applying Python has made me forget most of what I learned. resolved to do explore how I can use it and do quick projects in Python in my free time and apply as much of it as I can when opportunity arrives at work. This is one of the first exercises I did in Python which is about data cleaning. 


This project originates from the [realpython](https://realpython.com/python-data-cleaning-numpy-pandas/) website. It's an exercise where you learn the ff:

1. Dropping Columns in a DataFrame
2. Changing the Index of a DataFrame
3. Tidying up Fields in the Data
4. Combining str Methods with NumPy to Clean Columns
5. Cleaning the Entire Dataset Using the applymap Function
6. Renaming Columns and Skipping Rows
7. Python Data Cleaning: Recap and Resources
